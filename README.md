# REACT REMEMBER - MVC SAMPLE

code example demonstrates an implementation of the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architectural pattern in a React application.

Model: The model in this implementation consists of the useTodo custom hook defined in hooks/useTodo.js. It encapsulates the logic for managing the todos and handles interactions with localStorage. The model represents the data and business logic of the application.

View: The view components (TodoList, TodoItem, and TodoForm) are responsible for rendering the user interface and displaying the data. They receive data and callbacks from the model (custom hook) and present it to the user.

Controller: In the React context, the controller is typically represented by the event handlers and functions that manipulate the model or trigger changes in the application state. In this example, the event handlers in TodoForm (handleInputChange and handleAddTodo) and the deleteTodo function from the useTodo hook serve as the controllers. They handle user interactions, update the model (todos), and trigger re-renders of the view components.

By separating concerns and following the MVC pattern, the code becomes more modular, maintainable, and easier to understand. The model handles the data and logic, the view components render the UI, and the controllers facilitate the communication between the view and the model.
